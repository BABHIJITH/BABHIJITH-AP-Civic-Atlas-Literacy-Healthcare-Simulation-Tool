# 🏙️ Civic Impact Simulator: Literacy & Healthcare Access in Andhra Pradesh

An interactive geospatial simulator that visualizes district-level **literacy rates** and **healthcare access** across Andhra Pradesh. This tool integrates cleaned shapefiles, public census data, and simulated PHC (Primary Health Center) scores to help policymakers, researchers, and citizens explore civic disparities and simulate improvements.

## 📊 Features

- 🗺️ **Interactive Folium Map**  
  Hover over districts to view literacy rates and simulated healthcare scores.

- 🔄 **Dynamic Simulation**  
  Adjust parameters to simulate how literacy improvements affect healthcare access.

- 🧹 **Automated Data Cleaning**  
  Resolves name mismatches between shapefiles and CSV datasets.

- 📁 **Modular Codebase**  
  Easily extendable to include infrastructure, education, or sanitation metrics.

## 🧠 Motivation

Administrative boundaries and civic metrics often remain siloed. This simulator bridges that gap by:

- Aggregating real-world data from public sources.
- Cleaning and merging geospatial and tabular datasets.
- Enabling interactive exploration and simulation of civic outcomes.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add real PHC location data from NHM or state portals.
- Include infrastructure metrics like road density or school access.
- Enable time-series simulation for projected improvements.
